# Transplant Pathway

Original version by Mark Slaymaker, 10/07/2014

# Overview

This report is intended to be a starting point to facilitate a discussion about the requirements of the transplant patient pathway.  It aims to capture the various stages that a patient traverses.  It is intended that a patient focussed methodology be followed.  It is further hoped that, by the introduction of an efficient pathway support system, we can improve the patient experience by ensuring all the necessary information is available to the relevant team member at the appropriate time.

Once we have a full understanding of the pathway we can then conduct a gap analysis between what is required and the current features of the EPR system.  Once the gap analysis is completed we will be in a position ot develop a detailed requirements documetn stating what system needs to be developed.

It is the goal of this endeavour to provide a system to support the patient pathway within transplantation.

An orthoganoal ambition is to provide high quality research data.  In the initial stages the research data will be made available in the form of a number of standardised queries, whic ccan be parameterised.  It is anticipated that initially these queries will only produce aggregated results to maintain patient confidentiality.

The aim is to allow clinicians, managers and reserchers access to information pertaining to the performance of the transplant programme and allow identification of any trends that could warrant futher action.  We will also give consideration to how additional data collection could be integrated for additional reserch purposes.  This may need additional protocols that relate to the additional processes involved in obtaining relevant consent to tpermit the collection of supplementary information.

Throughout this document the term 'referring clinician' will be used to cover any clinician that could refer a patient including but not limited to Nephrologists, Diabetologies and GPs.

1.1  Data Needs
The data collected as a patiten traverses the pathway will be used to support several functions by fulfilling the needs of various customers.
