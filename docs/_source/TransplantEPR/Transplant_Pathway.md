# Transplant Pathway

Original version by Mark Slaymaker, 10/07/2014

# Overview

This report is intended to be a starting point to facilitate a discussion about the requirements of the transplant patient pathway.  It aims to capture the various stages that a patient traverses.  It is intended that a patient focussed methodology be followed.  It is further hoped that, by the introduction of an efficient pathway support system, we can improve the patient experience by ensuring all the necessary information is available to the relevant team member at the appropriate time.

Once we have a full understanding of the pathway we can then conduct a gap analysis between what is required and the current features of the EPR system.  Once the gap analysis is completed we will be in a position ot develop a detailed requirements documetn stating what system needs to be developed.

It is the goal of this endeavour to provide a system to support the patient pathway within transplantation.

An orthoganoal ambition is to provide high quality research data.  In the initial stages the research data will be made available in the form of a number of standardised queries, whic ccan be parameterised.  It is anticipated that initially these queries will only produce aggregated results to maintain patient confidentiality.

The aim is to allow clinicians, managers and reserchers access to information pertaining to the performance of the transplant programme and allow identification of any trends that could warrant futher action.  We will also give consideration to how additional data collection could be integrated for additional reserch purposes.  This may need additional protocols that relate to the additional processes involved in obtaining relevant consent to tpermit the collection of supplementary information.

Throughout this document the term 'referring clinician' will be used to cover any clinician that could refer a patient including but not limited to Nephrologists, Diabetologies and GPs.

1.1  Data Needs
The data collected as a patiten traverses the pathway will be used to support several functions by fulfilling the needs of various customers.  The primary uses can be classified as:  Clinical, Managerial, Madatory reporting, Evaluation and Research.  The following givea a brief summary of the key data consumers and the types of data that they require.

1.1.1 Clinical
There is a minimum set o fdata that needs to be collected for clinical reasons.  This data is necessary to permit clinical staff to perform their function effectively and maintain patient safety.  The exact makeup of the required data will depend on the clinical specialty concerned.  Although, there will be a core set of data that will usually be needed alonside a more extensive discipline specific data set.

1.1.2. Managerial
The managerial dta collection is necessary to maintain the smooth running of the department.  It is imprortant to collect data that allows the rapid identification of potential problem areas.

1.1.3 Mandatory Reporting
There is a requirement to provide data to certain external bodies such as the Renal Registry and NHSBT.  This reporting is mandatory and the informaiton required is specified by these bodies.  It is therfore essential that any information necesary to comply with these requirements is collected in an appropriate way.
