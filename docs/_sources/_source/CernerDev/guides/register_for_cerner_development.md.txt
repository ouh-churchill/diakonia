# How-to: Register for Cerner Development Access
Key tasks to do to enable effective developer setup

## Pre-requisites:

* OUH Contract (employee or honorary)
* OUH Smartcard (thus registered on Trust AD systems)
* Access to [OUH eLMS platform](https://enterprisestudy.com)

## Steps:

There is some imprecision over which steps are compulsory and for whom as we've experienced four different pathways for four different developers in the past year. The steps below are a reflection of the various activities undertaken which should encapsulate all the differences.

### Do training for:

* **EPR PAS Foundation** [`PVO`] - Classroom (with online elements related to Global PAS)
* **EPR PAS Foundation E-Assessment V6** [`EPRPASFOUNDASSV1`] - Online Assessment
* **EPR PAS Inpatients** [`PIP`] - Classroom
* **EPR PAS Waiting Lists** [`PWL`] - Classroom (only)
* **GPAS e-Learning Programme** [`GPeLP`] is a wrapper for all the *OPGP 0xx* courses and are exclusively online
* **EPR Clinicals Overview** [`COL`] - Classroom
* **EPR - Clinic Management for Clinical Staff** [`COPPROG`] - is a wrapper for the *Outpatient 0xx* online courses
* **EPR - Millennium Basics for Doctors - eLearning Programme** [`OCDeLP`] is a wrapper for *EPR X.Xy* online courses and includes the eAssessment module
* **EPR Doctors - Admission, Inpatients, Discharge - eLearning Programme** [`DAID`] is a wrapper for two online courses and an assessment module
* **EPR - Meds Prescribing - eLearning Programme v4** [`MPv4`] - is a wrapper for *ePrescribing 0xx* online courses and assessment
* **EPR Medication Administration - eLearning Programme** [`ADMPROGv1`] - is a wrapper for *Meds Administration 0xx* online courses and assessment
* **EPR Inpatients for Nurses - eLearning Programme** [`IPNeLP`] - is a wrapper for *ADT Nurse 0xx* online courses
* **EPR Order Comms for Nurses - eLearning Programme** [`OCNeLP`] - is a wrapper for online courses and assessment

You can optionally do:

* **Trust Induction - Doctors' Essential eLearning Instructions** [`DEeLI`] - which lists several EPR modules that are compulsory for Doctors at OUH

You can skip:

* **EPR PAS Outpatients** [`POP`] - not strictly obsolete, but consists almost entirely of Global PAS (`OPGP`) courses in a classroom, so can be done online.
* **EPR - Clinic Management for Clinical Staff - Classroom Course** [`CMCS`] this course isn't being scheduled and is mostly covered in EPR Order Comms for Doctors and EPR Millennium Basics for Doctors, as well as the online `COPPROG` modules
* **EPR - eLearning for Doctors** [`EPReLDoc`] isn't currently scheduled, but is a drop-in help session for the `OCDeLP` courses
* **EPR - Order Comms for Doctors - Classroom Course** [`CFD`] isn't currently scheduled

Ignore the following courses/assessments as they are obsolete/unsupported by OUH Training (as of Sep 2017):

* **EPR PAS Inpatients Assessment** V3 and V3-1 [`EPRPASIPASSV2`]
* **EPR PAS Outpatients Assessment** V2 and V3 [`EPRPASOPASSV1`]
* **EPR PAS Waitlist Assessment** V3_1 and V3_2 [`EPWAV3-2`]
