# Project Setup Notes

Starting with notes from [https://github.com/AllyBradley/COPE/blob/master/docs/deployment.rst](https://github.com/AllyBradley/COPE/blob/master/docs/deployment.rst) and `development.rst`. Note that development doesn’t talk about starting a new project with virtualenv!

Need to make a project directory using python 3.5.2 (latest as of time of writing)
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1534210/use-different-python-version-with-virtualenv](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1534210/use-different-python-version-with-virtualenv)

* `mkproject -p /usr/local/bin/python3 diakonia`

Results in us going to `/Users/$USER$/Projects/diakonia`

Create a project on github : [https://github.com/ouh-churchill/diakoinia](https://github.com/ouh-churchill/diakoinia]), then clone it…

* `git clone git@github.com:ouh-churchill/diakonia.git diakonia-repo`
* `ln -s ~/.virtualenvs/diakonia/lib ./lib`
* `ln -s ~/.virtualenvs/diakonia/bin ./bin`

Open project in PyCharm, and create requirements file (`requirements/common.txt` and `development.txt`).

* `pip install -r diakonia-repo/requirements/development.txt`

## Creating the initial project

Start the django project:

* `cd diakonia-repo`
* `django-admin startproject diakonia`

Then move some things around…

* Move `manage.py` to `diakonia-repo/`
* Move and rename `diakonia/` to `diakonia-repo/config/`
* Edit `manage.py` and `wsgi.py` to point at `“config.settings”`

After that, PyCharm will want a few settings tweaks (like Django support enabling, and pointing at the settings files). I tend to hold of on this until I've also sorted out the setup of Best Practice for settings and other folders/files that form part of the project boilerplate.

# Dev System Notes

## FHIRbase Install
On OS X 10.11.6, this has been a series of forward and backward steps. 

Homebrew supports the latest version of software, and one or two older versions. For FHIRbase to install locally we need the following stack:

* Postgres (v9.5.3 currently)
* FHIRbase(2) - [https://github.com/fhirbase/fhirbase-plv8](https://github.com/fhirbase/fhirbase-plv8) (v1.4.0 currently)
* plv8 - [https://github.com/plv8/plv8 http://pgxn.org/dist/plv8/](https://github.com/plv8/plv8 http://pgxn.org/dist/plv8/)- (current is v1.5.3, but using v1.4.3 because it supports the older version of v8 available from the Homebrew Version archive)
* v8 - via Homebrew Versions archive - (current is v5.1; but using v3.15 as this is the only historic version at present available)

Can now condense this down to the following:

* `brew install v8-315` -- only works since June 2016
* `pip install pgxnclient`
* `LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/opt/v8-315/lib" CPATH="/usr/local/opt/v8-315/include" pgxnclient install plv8=1.4.3`
* Then we follow [https://github.com/fhirbase/fhirbase-plv8#installation](https://github.com/fhirbase/fhirbase-plv8#installation)
	* `psql -d postgres` -- because there isn't a DB named after the local user. We now are in the PSQL CLI:
	* `CREATE DATABASE fhirbase;`. Then exit CLI
	* `export DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/fhirbase` -- remember to escape any symbols in password
	* `wget https://github.com/fhirbase/fhirbase-plv8/releases/download/v1.4.0.0/fhirbase-1.4.0.0.sql.zip`
	* `unzip fhirbase-1.4.0.0.sql.zip`
	* `cat fhirbase-1.4.0.0.sql | psql fhirbase`
* And it worked fine. Tested by creating patient storage, seeing new tables generated, and then removed the storage.


## Sphinx Install

Sphinx is configured to create documentation outputs ([#39](https://github.com/ouh-churchill/diakonia/issues/39)), and scan for django code. The html documentation is then auto-generated by a Travis process for display via GitHub pages.

To publish:

* In the `diakonia` repo, edit your documents (in `/docs-source/_source/`), and commit changes.

To manually generate the output:

* From the cli, whilst **in the diakonia virtualenv**:
	* `cd docs-source`
	* `make gh-html`
	* For the quick commit, it can be: `git add --all; git commit -m 'updates'; git push`
	
Online documents can then be seen at [https://ouh-churchill.github.io](https://ouh-churchill.github.io) which now redirects to the Diakonia project sub-folder.

# Test Server

There is now a staging/test server available at dev.nds.ox.ac.uk, and diakonia has been installed as a project on there using the following setup.

* Create project `$ mkproject -p /usr/bin/python3 diakonia`
  * This will activate the new virtualenv, and drop you into `/sites/diakonia `
* Create project user `$ sudo useradd --system --gid worker --shell /bin/bash --home /sites/diakonia diakonia-app-user`
* Clone repository
  * `$ git clone git@github.com:ouh-churchill/diakonia.git diakonia_repo`
* Create subfolders, link virtualenv folders
  * `$ ln -s /sites/.virtualenvs/diakonia/lib ./lib`
  * `$ ln -s /sites/.virtualenvs/diakonia/bin ./bin` 
  * `$ mkdir -p var/log var/run etc/nginx/sites-available htdocs/media etc/gunicorn misc/data/nhsbt`
* Install requirements
  * `$ cd diakonia_repo/`
  * `$ pip install -r requirements/staging.txt`
* Modify local `.env` settings
  * `$ cp config/settings/.env.template config/settings/.env`
  * `$ vi config/settings/.env` -- Put in local setting values
  * `$ python manage.py check`
* Create database - using sqlite initially, migrating to Postgres at a later date.
  * Check it is current with `$ python manage.py migrate`, there should be no missing migrations.
* Copy the static content into place `$ python manage.py collectstatic`

ToDo: Setup NGinx configuration behind the main reverse proxy on this server.

## Operations

* Securely copy latest (or all) data sources to the relevant folder on the system `/sites/diakonia/misc/data`
* If new session, ensure virtualenv is active (`$ workon diakonia`), and you are in the repository folder (`$ cd diakonia_repo/`)
* Load the new data files one at a time:
  * `$ python manage.py load_nhsbt /full/path/to/datafile.ext`
  * *Be prepared to wait several minutes for each file, this is not a quick operation (and this is on old and slow hardware)*
* Produce an export in XML:
  * `$ python manage.py export_xml`
  * This export is currently hardwired to go into the eyeaux app, `tmp/` folder as `tests.xml`
  * *This aspect will want some working on in terms of a secure access process for exporting to our partner sites*
