The Citrix presented virtual desktops we use are for Windows 2008 Server (Service Pack 2?). This platform is currently in Extended Microsoft Support until Jan 14th 2020 (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search/1163). There are currently two newer major releases of the Windows Server platform since this (2012 & 2016)

Cerner has a [GitHub account](https://github.com/cerner) with a range of projects on it! Including details on for [FHIR-on-Cerner](https://github.com/cerner/fhir.cerner.com). [Terra related code](https://github.com/cerner/terra-core) is here, which leads to...

[Terra UI](http://terra-ui.herokuapp.com/home) - Terra UI offers a set of configurable React components designed to help build scalable and modular healthcare focused applications. These components follow Cerner’s Design Standard Guidelines and are well-maintained and tested. The UI framework easily integrates with webpack-based workflows and was created to solve real-world issues in projects we work on day to day.

Cerner's [SMART on FHIR tutorial](http://engineering.cerner.com/smart-on-fhir-tutorial/) is a basic example of how a FHIR app can be built and run with [example code](https://github.com/cerner/smart-on-fhir-tutorial).


Looking into the [Cerner Millennium API](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=cerner+millennium+api) results should be interesting - [https://code.cerner.com](https://code.cerner.com) looks promising as:

... however this appears to be **a shell website consisting of minimal marketing and zero content**. Its purpose is to sign you up to a newsletter. At time of writing most of the content is on a Blog within the site, and hasn't been updated in 4 months, with the first update from Oct 2015, but they're short link articles to press releases on the main Cerner site.

Yet, from Google (and not easily findable from the site), you can see https://code.cerner.com/ehr-api, which essentially links you to http://fhir.cerner.com and the SMART On FHIR example marketing material.
