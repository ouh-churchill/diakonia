# Cerner Database Schema Documentation (OUH Edition)

This is the growing collective understanding of the base database structures the underpins all the OUH clinical data

Ultimately this data resides in Oracle (version?) databases.

To view the database, recommend using the [Oracle SQL Database Developer IDE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html). Unsurprisingly this is a Java application, and thus there are Mac and Windows versions [1] [Documentation is online](http://docs.oracle.com/database/sql-developer-17.2/index.html) or can be downloaded. To use the software you'll need an xml configuration file (internal only) for connection details.
