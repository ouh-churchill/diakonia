# Project Diakonia
Ministers to the data needs of the departments. Collection of custom app developments for clinical data analysis or 
support, and open documentation.

## Why "Diakonia"?

The name was a suggestion of Dr G Vallance, and is (to quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaconia)) "a 
Christian theological term from Greek that encompasses the call to serve the poor and oppressed.". Whilst there's no
religious component to our actions, the data analysis needs for clinical service and research are often underserved and
the work here has been in response to some of those needs.

## Why "Diakonia-Open"?

... because there's also an internal/private repository following the same needs, but limited to material that we are
presently unable to share more openly for a variety of reasons.

# Note

This starts of as a location for apps to be developed and deployed within a single environment, but as they progress 
they will likely be moved off into their own repositories and packages for more sensible management.
